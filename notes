We are using tailwindcss,
add cdn link, and config for font.

For qrcode library, go to cdnjs.com 
copy the script.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

TAILWINDCSS:

https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation

use the CLI method.

For me the styles were not applying, then i checked.

The second step,
adding /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{html,js}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
} 
to tailwindcss config file was the problem.

Please read https://tailwindcss.com/docs/content-configuration

replace it with ,
 content: [
    './**/*.{html,js}',
  ],

to write styles for mobile, first write style for mobile and then override for other screens, 
for example, we want div1 div2 as flex-row in larger screens and as flex-col-reverse in mobile, you have 
to specify as 
 <div class="flex flex-col-reverse md:flex-row">
            <div>Div 1</div>
            <div>Div 2</div>
        </div>
